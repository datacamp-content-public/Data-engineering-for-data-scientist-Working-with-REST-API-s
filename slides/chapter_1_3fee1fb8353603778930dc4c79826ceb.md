## Data engineering for data scientists: Working with REST-API's

Hi, and welcome to this course on working with REST-API's. My name is Jeroen Boeye and I'm a data scientist at Faktion.

## Basic data science workflow

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "b998427bd8"
center_content: false
```

`@part1`

`@script`
As a data scientist you’ll often be working with a local dataset which you were given, or which you imported from some data source, you tidy the data, transform it to a workable format, explore it visually and then build a model, at some point you gain a new understanding and communicate your conclusions to colleagues or clients. 

This approach is valuable, and the foundation for many analyses. However, what will you do when management decides your model is so great, that they want you to integrate it in a larger architecture so that the predictions can be made on demand.

## Talking to other applications

```yaml
type: "TwoRows"
key: "20ef0e8a55"
```

`@part1`
What if you want to allow others to use you model?

- They send data and your model returns prediction


`@part2`
What if you want to get data from other web services?

- E.g you send location and receive weather forecast


`@script`
What if you want to allow others to send your model some new data and have it immediately return a prediction. Or what if to make that prediction your model needs up to date input from some web service, like a weather forecast. 
In both cases, you need a way for different applications to talk to one another.
You want your application, containing the model, to be able to ask a weather forecasts web service for recent data and you want others to be able to ask your model for a prediction.

## API's

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "8ca2e7205c"
disable_transition: false
```

`@part1`
**A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface
- Defined methods of communication between various applications
- Allows applications written in different programming languages to work together
- **REST** is most popular design ruleset for web API's


`@script`
This is where API’s come in. API stands for Application Programming Interface. API’s allow you to program how different applications talk to one another. The nice thing is that it does not matter much what happens on the inside of each application, whether it is written in Pyhton or something else, as long as the communication layer is agreed upon. Now this agreement is important, like with different human languages there are plenty of ways in which applications can talk to one another. You could even invent your own set of rules. However that would make it hard for others to understand and use your application's API. To avoid this issue the computer science community has agreed on a set of universal design rules for API’s. Currently the most popular one of which is called REST.
The REST ruleset will be the one we follow in this course. You’ll learn how you can fetch data from web services, and how you can build a web service with a REST-full API on top, so that others can talk to it. Finally you’ll upgrade your web service to contain a model which other applications can ask for predictions.

## Let's do this!

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "5f3323555c"
```

`@script`
Building and hosting a full blown web-service is typically a job for a specialised Devops and data engineering team, and learning how to do all that in a production environment is not the purpose of this course. However, being able to fetch data from REST API’s is a super relevant skill for data scientists. And the basics you’ll learn on how to create your own web-service with an API, will be really handy when you get to integrating you model into a larger architecture. So let's do this!
