## Data engineering for data scientists: Working with REST-API's

```yaml
type: "TitleSlide"
key: "2fe1992c79"
assignment: "Working with REST-API's"
```

Hi, and welcome to this course on working with REST-API's. My name is Jeroen Boeye and I'm a data scientist at Faktion.

## Basic data science workflow

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "b998427bd8"
center_content: false
```

`@part1`

`@script`
As a data scientist you’ll often be working with a local dataset which you were given or imported from some source, you tidy the data, transform it to a workable format, explore it visually and then build a model, at some point you learn something from the data and communicate your conclusions to colleagues or clients. 

This approach is valuable and the default for many analyses. However, what will you do when management decides your model is so great that they want it to make predictions on demand?

## Talking to other applications

```yaml
type: "TwoRows"
key: "20ef0e8a55"
```

`@part1`
What if you want to allow others to use you model?

- They send data and your model returns prediction


`@part2`
What if you want to get data from other web services?

- E.g you send location and receive weather forecast


`@script`
Let’s say you build a classifier model, you want to allow others to send your model some new data and have it immediately return a predicted class. Your old approach does not support this type of workflow. You might be in even more trouble if your model expects recent data like a weather forecast as it’s input. 
You’ll need to write some code that asks a web service that provides weather forecasts for recent data when you give it a location. In both cases, you need a way for different applications, like your model, to talk to one another.

## API's

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "8ca2e7205c"
disable_transition: false
```

`@part1`
**A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface
- Defined methods of communication between various components
- REST is most popular design ruleset for web API's


`@script`
This is where API’s come in. API stands for Application Programming Interface. API’s allow you to program how different applications talk to one another. Now just like with different human languages there are plenty of ways how applications go about talking to one another. You could even invent your own set of rules. However that would make it hard for others to understand and use your application's API. To avoid this issue the computer science community has agreed on a set of universal design rules for API’s. Currently the most popular one of which is called REST.
This ruleset will be the one we follow in this course. You’ll learn how you can fetch data from web services, how you can build a web service with a REST-full API on top so that others can talk to it, and finally you’ll upgrade your web service to contain a model which other applications can ask for predictions.

## Let's do this!

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "5f3323555c"
```

`@script`
Building and hosting a full blown web-service is typically a job for a specialised Devops and data engineering team, and learning how to do all that in a production environment is not the purpose of this course. However, being able to fetch data from REST API’s is a super relevant skill for data scientists. And the basics you’ll learn on how to create your own web-service with an API will be really handy when you get to integrating you model in a production environment.
