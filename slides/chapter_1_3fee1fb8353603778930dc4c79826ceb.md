`@script`
As a data scientist youâ€™ll often be working with a local dataset which you were given or imported from some source, you tidy the data, transform it to a workable format, explore it visually and then build a model, at some point you learn something from the data and communicate your conclusions to colleagues or clients. 

This approach is valuable and the default for many analyses. However, what will you do when management decides your model is so great that they want it to make predictions on demand?
